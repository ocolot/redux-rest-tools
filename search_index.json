It provides action creators, reducers generator, state normalization and a middleware to handle the request flow... with the REST convention in mind. It is meant to ease HTTP requests and data handling while ensuring performance and state consistency.\nREST action creators use redux-actions under the hood to create FSA-complient set of actions. For each request, a request, success and fail action creator will be generate with the possibility to pass success/failure handlers to deal with the consequences of a successful/failed API request.\nREST reducers use immutable objects for their slice of the state (but the whole state is not required to se immutable). They handle immutable and JS action payloads for state update, but immutable data structure are preferred to increase state update performance and reduce from/to JS conversion efforts (note: in a React app, you might avoid using toJS() in mapStateToProps to speed up UI refresh pace).\nEach state slice managed by a REST reducer is normalized based on the entities' unique identifiers (e.g. the object ID, see idPath). Their shapes look like { result: [...], entities: {...}, ui: {...}, errors: {...} }, where result is the list of entity IDs, entities is an object where each key is an entity ID and its content is the entity itself, ui is used to store request states, and errors the errors that may occur during the API calls.\nThe REST middleware handles the async request flow. It starts with a request action triggering the actual HTTP request using axios. If the request succeed, the success action is dispatched; else the fail action is dispatched. To deal with the consequences of a successful/failed request, you may pass onSuccessAction/onFailAction action creators and onSuccess/onFail function in the request action meta to be called with the request results.\nInstallation\nTo install the stable version with npm:\nnpm install --save redux-rest-tools\nor with yarn:\nyarn add redux-rest-tools\nUsage\nGenerate the actions, reducer and middleware to handle an API returning a collection of users:\nimport { createRestActions, restReducer, middleware } from 'redux-rest-tools'\n\n// To create REST actions:\nconst usersActions = createRestActions({\n  collection: 'users', // the name of the collection\n  verbs: ['find', 'findOne', 'create', 'update', 'delete'], // put the verbs you need\n})\n\n// To create the REST reducer:\nconst usersReducer = restReducer({\n  idPath: 'id', // the unique identifier used for each object\n  actions: usersActions, // the reducer will handle the verbs present in usersActions\n})\n\n// To create the REST middleware:\nconst usersMiddleware = middleware({\n  baseRoute: '/api/users', // the REST API endpoint\n  idPath: 'id', // e.g. findOne route will look like /api/users/:id\n  actions: usersActions, // the middleware will handle the verbs present in usersActions\n})\n\nHere's one way to use them in a React app:\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { render } from 'react-dom'\nimport { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'\nimport { Provider } from 'react-redux'\nimport { combineReducers } from 'redux-immutable'\n\nimport App from './containers/App' // your root React component\n\nconst rootReducer = combineReducers({\n  usersReducer,\n  // ... add other reducers here\n})\n\nconst store = createStore(\n  rootReducer,\n  applyMiddleware(\n    usersMiddleware\n    // ... add other middlewares here\n  )\n)\n\nrender(\n  \n    \n  ,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n)\n\nNote that we use a fully immutable state in the above (that is why we use combineReducers from redux-immutable). If you wish to use redux-rest-tools within a non immutable state, you may simply use Redux's version of combineReducers (the state slice(s) managed by redux-rest-tools will remain immutable, see the helpers documentation to retrieve JS objects instead of immutable ones).\nExamples\n\ngithub-users\n\nDocumentation\nSee full documentation\nContribution & Feedback\nredux-rest-tools is at an early stage of development.
